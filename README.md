# CS250-Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

In this course I learned that interpretating user needs begins by clarifying details through questions and breaking down requirements into managable user stories. During the SNHU Travel Project, acceptance criteria as well as backlog refinement helped us as a team determine what needed to be prioritized. The user stories help maintain focus on delivering small sprints of value incrementally rather than all at once while also providing clarity for business goals.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Instead of trying to complete entire projects before testing or reviewing it, I now build incrementally and test frequently. I used to approach these projects sequentially and ran into a lot of problems but I have a better grip on things when they are kept small and integrated slowly rather than all at once. Agile practices like Daily Scrums, backlog refinement, and continuous integration (with emphasis on that last one) all stood out as valuable practices. I hope to incorporate smaller and frequent integration, structured planning, and retrospective reflection into my future projects to improve my quality of work and efficiency.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a strong team member means to communicate efficiently with everyone, share responsability, and support others if problems arise. In our group discussions, collaboration between the team helped us continue progress and come to agreements and prevented siloed work like the Vision Quest Case Study. Good team members are supposed to contribute to these discussions, actively listen, and be flexible when things change. Agile reinforces the idea that "team work makes the dream work" especially in software development and relies on transparency and team work just as much as it does with technical skill.
